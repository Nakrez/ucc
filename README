UCC : Micro C Compiler
*****************************

* Informations

Ucc is a C compiler that aims at compiling C89 compliant programms (for now).
Ucc is written in C++ 11.
Ucc is in early stage development. Indeed it is only able to parse and build
AST from input files.

* Compilation

To compile UCC you only need to have a C++ 11 compliant compiler.
You just have to do these 3 commands to build it:

./bootstrap
./configure
make

* Documentation

To generate documentation simply run 'make doxygen-doc'. This will generate
the documentation in doc/gen

* Usage

Usage: ucc [OPTION...] file...
ucc: Micro C compiler

      --ast-print            Pretty print the input file (debug purpose)
      --ast-print-bindings   Pretty print the input file compute and print the
                             bindings associated (debug purpose)
  -b, --compute-bindings     Compute bindings on the AST
  -p, --parse                Parse the input file
      --parse-trace          Activate parse trace
  -?, --help                 Give this help list
      --usage                Give a short usage message

* Status

- PARSER (C89, with gcc extension) : 90%
- AST : 90% (cannot embed "__asm__" statements and "gcc __attribute__")
- PRETTY-PRINTER : 90% (print the generated AST from the code)
- BINDER : 90% (link usage of variables, types, ... To their definitions)
- TYPE CHECKER : 0%
- MIDDLE END : 0%
- BACK END : 0%

* License

UCC is under GPL2. See COPYING file for more informations.

* Known bugs

- The parser as some problem with type definitions. Once a typedef defines an
identifier this identifier is flagged as type no matter redefinition in
different scopes
